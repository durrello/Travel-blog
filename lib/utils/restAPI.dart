            "A two and a half hour drive south of Douala, getting to Kribi is relatively easy. However, it's important to note that Kribi (and Cameroon in general) is not the type of destination a tourist should travel to without local help. Once there, we took a 45 minute canoe ride along the Lobe river into the forest. This ride can be intimidating for first timers, but it is well worth it for the serenity alone. Crisp air, still waters, birds chirping, and if you're lucky - small monkeys swinging from the trees.Enjoy your vacation with warmth and amazing sightseeing on the mountains.
